# tpt-telos Architecture

## Pipeline

```
Source (.telos) → Parser → AST → IR/Constraint Extraction → QF_LRA Verifier
                                                           ↓
                                          Agentic Transpiler (Generate → Verify → Counter-example → Rewrite)
                                                           ↓
                                              Context Router → Rust / Go / Python Backend
                                                           ↓
                                              Code Generation → FFI Bridge (if dual-backend)
                                                           ↓
                                              Eject Hatch → LSP Server

## Go GC Determinism

### Background

Go uses a concurrent, tri-color mark-and-sweep garbage collector. While Go's GC has
sub-millisecond pause times in practice, it is **non-deterministic**: the exact timing
and duration of GC pauses depend on heap pressure, allocation patterns, and runtime
scheduling. This makes Go unsuitable for hard real-time systems where worst-case
execution time (WCET) must be bounded.

### Safe Go-Routed Modules

The following `@boundary(...)` flags route to the Go backend and are **safe** for
soft real-time and general server workloads:

| Flag | Use Case | GC Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `network_io` | HTTP/gRPC handlers, WebSocket servers | Low — allocation-heavy but latency-tolerant |
| `high_concurrency` | Goroutine pools, fan-out/fan-in | Low — GC scales with heap, not goroutine count |
| `distributed` | Distributed consensus, RPC clients | Low — network latency dominates GC pauses |
| `high_latency` | Background jobs, batch processing | Negligible — latency budget is seconds+ |

These modules are safe because their latency budgets are measured in milliseconds or
seconds, far exceeding typical GC pause times (< 1ms on modern hardware with heaps
under 1 GB).

### Unsafe Go-Routed Modules

The following combinations route to Go but are **unsafe** for hard real-time:

| Flag Combination | Why Unsafe |
|-------------------|------------|
| `real_time` + `network_io` | `real_time` implies WCET requirements; Go GC violates them |
| `zero_allocation` + `high_concurrency` | `zero_allocation` implies no GC; Go always allocates via GC |
| `real_time` + any Go flag | `real_time` requires deterministic execution; Go GC is non-deterministic |

When these combinations are detected, the router emits:
- `WARNING [real_time_go_conflict]` — module has `real_time` but is routed to Go
- `WARNING [zero_alloc_go_conflict]` — module has `zero_allocation` but is routed to Go

Use `--strict-rt` to promote these warnings to hard errors (non-zero exit).

### Hard Real-Time Guidelines

For FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control), PREEMPT_RT, and other hard
real-time targets:

1. **Always use the Rust backend** — Rust has no GC; execution time is bounded.
2. **Use `@boundary(real_time)` or `@boundary(zero_allocation)`** — these route
   to Rust by default.
3. **Never combine `real_time` with Go-bound flags** — the router will warn or
   error with `--strict-rt`.
4. **Avoid heap allocation in hot paths** — use stack-allocated data structures
   and `&mut` references.
